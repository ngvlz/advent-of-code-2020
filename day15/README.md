## Puzzle

The input puzzle is a list of starting numbers. Each turn consists of considering the the last number in the list:

- If that was the **first time** the number appears in the list, the next number is 0.
- Otherwise, the last number is a repeat; the next number is how many turns apart the number is from when it previously appeared (also called the **number age**).

### Question 1

### Question 2
