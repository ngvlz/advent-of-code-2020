## Puzzle 1

In the puzzle input, the same pattern of `.` and `#` repeats to the right many times

The slope is `right 3`, `down 1`:

Starting at the top-left corner of the map and following the slope, how many `#` are encountered?

## Puzzle 2

The slopes are [`right 3, down 1`], [`right 5, down 1`], [`right 7, down 1`], [`right 1, down 2`]

By multiply together the number of `#` encountered on each of the listed slopes, what is the result?
